OTF-Documentation
=========================

Private repository (currently), holding spot, to put documentation for the Open Tooling Framework.

This needs to be hosted/opened on a server and uses [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/). 

Text is added in dynamically based on the text in the JSON files in the /inc folder.

Not to be redistributed further until the IHTSDO has made the documentation public.
